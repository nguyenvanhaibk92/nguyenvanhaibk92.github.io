I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin since January 2021. I obtained his Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Civil Engineering from Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology, after which I worked as a graduate research assistant and teaching assistant at the same university.

My current interests are in the broad areas of machine learning, numerical analysis, and scientific computing. I have developed the model-constrained deep learning approaches for accelerating both numerical simulations and inverse problems. At the heart of the model-constrained learning approaches is the combination of data randomization and differentiable physics model, leading to a low demand on training data, good generalization, long term prediction stability, and more. I invented the implicit neural representation machine learning approaches for solving challenges in geomodeling and geophysics inversion for the first time in academia and industry. Additionally, I also self-studied and worked on designing transformer architecture, generative models (VAEs, energy-based models, diffusion models), and foundation models.
<!-- to achieve higher order convergence rate for time-series physics data. -->
Beyond machine learning, I proposed a data-informed active subspace framework and unified randomized algorithm for solving inverse problems.

I love coding and sharing useful tutorials with others. I recorded some useful tricks and tips during my Ph.D. journey in this [Github repo](https://github.com/nguyenvanhaibk92/PhD.utils). My favorite machine learning platform is [JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/) which allows my to work flexibly with machine learning, differentiable PDEs solver, and computation parallelism.
